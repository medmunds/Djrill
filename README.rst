Djrill, for Mandrill
====================

Djrill is an email backend and new message class for Django users that want to take advantage of the Mandrill_ transactional
email service from MailChimp_.

An optional Django admin interface is included. The admin interface allows you to:

* Check the status of your Mandrill API connection.
* See stats on email tags and urls.

Djrill is made available under the BSD license.

Installation
------------

Install from PyPI::

    pip install djrill

Note: the fork you're looking at here is likely different from the official
release in PyPI. If you *really* want *this* version, you can install it
directly from github::

    pip install git+git://github.com/medmunds/Djrill.git#egg=djrill

The only dependency other than Django is the requests_ library from Kenneth
Reitz. (If you do not install Djrill using pip or setuptools, you will also
need to ``pip install requests``.)

Configuration
-------------

In ``settings.py``:

1. Add ``djrill`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        "djrill"
    )

2. Add the following line, substituting your own ``MANDRILL_API_KEY``:

.. code:: python

    MANDRILL_API_KEY = "brack3t-is-awesome"

3. Override your existing email backend with the following line:

.. code:: python

    EMAIL_BACKEND = "djrill.mail.backends.djrill.DjrillBackend"

4. (optional) If you want to be able to add senders through Django's admin or
   view stats about your messages, do the following in your base ``urls.py``:

.. code:: python

    ...
    from django.contrib import admin

    from djrill import DjrillAdminSite

    admin.site = DjrillAdminSite()
    admin.autodiscover()
    ...

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
    )

Usage
-----

Since you are replacing the global ``EMAIL_BACKEND``, **all** emails are sent through Mandrill's service.

In general, Djrill "just works" with Django's built-in `django.core.mail`_
package, including ``send_mail``, ``send_mass_mail``, ``EmailMessage`` and
``EmailMultiAlternatives``.

You can also take advantage of Mandrill-specific features like tags, metadata,
and tracking by creating a ``django.mail.EmailMessage`` (or for HTML,
``django.mail.EmailMultiAlternatives``) object and setting Mandrill-specific
properties on it before calling its ``send`` method.

Example:

.. code:: python

    from django.core.mail import EmailMultiAlternatives # or just EmailMessage if you don't need HTML

    subject = "Djrill Message"
    from_email = "Djrill Sender <djrill@example.com>" # this has to be in your Mandrill account's sending domains
    to = ["Djrill Receiver <djrill.receiver@example.com>", "djrill.two@example.com"]
    reply_email = "Customer Service <support@example.com>" # optional
    text_content = "This is the text version of your email"
    html_content = "<p>This is the HTML version of your email</p>" # optional, use with ``attach_alternative`` below

    msg = EmailMultiAlternatives(subject, text_content, from_email, to, headers={'Reply-To': reply_email})
    msg.tags = ["one tag", "two tag", "red tag", "blue tag"] # optional, Mandrill-specific message extension
    msg.metadata = {'user_id': "8675309"} # optional, Mandrill-specific message extension
    msg.attach_alternative(html_content, "text/html")
    msg.send()

If the Mandrill API returns an error response for any reason, the send call will
raise a ``djrill.mail.backends.djrill.DjrillBackendHTTPError`` exception
(unless called with fail_silently=True).

Djrill supports most of the functionality of Django's ``EmailMessage`` and
``EmailMultiAlternatives``. Some limitations:

* Djrill accepts additional headers, but only ``Reply-To`` and ``X-*`` (since
  that is all that Mandrill accepts). Any other extra headers will raise a
  ``ValueError`` exception when you attempt to send the message.
* Djrill requires that if you ``attach_alternative`` to a message, there must be
  only one alternative type, and it must be text/html. Otherwise, Djrill will
  raise a ``ValueError`` exception when you attempt to send the message.
  (Mandrill doesn't support sending multiple html alternative parts, or any
  non-html alternatives.)
* Djrill (currently) silently ignores all attachments on a message.
* Djrill treats all cc and bcc recipients as if they were additional "to"
  addresses. (Mandrill does not distinguish cc, and only allows a single bcc --
  which Djrill doesn't use. *Caution:* depending on the ``preserve_recipients``
  setting, this could result in exposing bcc addresses to all recipients. It's
  probably best to just avoid bcc.)

Many of the options from the Mandrill `messages/send.json API`_ ``message``
struct can be set directly on an ``EmailMessage`` (or subclass) object:

* ``track_opens`` - Boolean
* ``track_clicks`` - Boolean (If you want to track clicks in HTML only, not
  plaintext mail, you must *not* set this property, and instead just set the
  default in your Mandrill account sending options.)
* ``auto_text`` - Boolean
* ``url_strip_qs`` - Boolean
* ``preserve_recipients`` - Boolean -- see the caution about bcc addresses above
* ``global_merge_vars`` - a dict -- e.g.,
  ``{ 'company': "ACME", 'offer': "10% off" }``
* ``recipient_merge_vars`` - a dict whose keys are the recipient email addresses
  and whose values are dicts of merge vars for each recipient -- e.g.,
  ``{ 'wiley@example.com': { 'offer': "15% off anvils" } }``
* ``tags`` - a list of strings
* ``google_analytics_domains`` - a list of string domain names
* ``google_analytics_campaign`` - a string or list of strings
* ``metadata`` - a dict
* ``recipient_metadata`` - a dict whose keys are the recipient email addresses,
  and whose values are dicts of metadata for each recipient (similar to
  ``recipient_merge_vars``)

These Mandrill-specific properties work with *any* ``EmailMessage``-derived
object, so you can use them with many other apps that add Django mail
functionality (such as Django template-based messages).

If you have any questions about the python syntax for any of these properties,
see ``DjrillMandrillFeatureTests`` in tests.py for examples.


Testing
-------

Djrill is tested against Django 1.3 and 1.4 on Python 2.6 and 2.7.
(It may also work with Django 1.2 and Python 2.5, if you use an older
version of requests compatible with that code.)

The included tests verify that Djrill constructs the expected Mandrill API
calls, without actually calling Mandrill or sending any email. So the tests
don't require a Mandrill API key, but they *do* require mock_
(``pip install mock``). To run the tests, either::

    python setup.py test

or::

    python runtests.py


Thanks
------

Thanks to the MailChimp team for asking us to build this nifty little app. Also thanks to James Socol on Github for his 
django-adminplus_ library that got us off on the right foot for the custom admin views. Oh, and, of course, Kenneth Reitz for 
the awesome ``requests`` library.

Djrill, for Mandrill
====================

Djrill is an email backend and new message class for Django users that want to take advantage of the Mandrill_ transactional 
email service from MailChimp_.

An optional Django admin interface is included. The admin interface allows you to:

* Check the status of your Mandrill API connection.
* Add/disable email senders.
* See stats on email tags and urls.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install djrill

The only dependency other than Django is the requests_ library from Kenneth Reitz. If you do not install through PyPI you will 
need to do::

    pip install requests

Configuration
-------------

In ``settings.py``:

1. Add ``djrill`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        "djrill"
    )

2. Add the following line, substituting your own ``MANDRILL_API_KEY``:

.. code:: python

    MANDRILL_API_KEY = "brack3t-is-awesome"

3. Override your existing email backend with the following line:

.. code:: python

    EMAIL_BACKEND = "djrill.mail.backends.djrill.DjrillBackend"

4. (optional) If you want to be able to add senders through Django's admin or view stats about your 
   messages, do the following in your base ``urls.py``:

.. code:: python

    ...
    from django.contrib import admin

    from djrill import DjrillAdminSite

    admin.site = DjrillAdminSite()
    admin.autodiscover()
    ...

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
    )

Usage
-----

Since you are replacing the global ``EMAIL_BACKEND``, **all** emails are sent through Mandrill's service.

In general, Djrill "just works" with Django's built-in `django.mail`_ package, including ``send_mail``,
``send_mass_mail``, ``EmailMessage`` and (for sending HTML email) ``EmailMultiAlternatives``.

You can also take advantage of Mandrill-specific features like tags, metadata, and tracking by creating a
``django.mail.EmailMessage`` (or for HTML, ``django.mail.EmailMultiAlternatives``) object and setting Mandrill-specific
properties on it before calling its ``send`` method.

Example:

.. code:: python

    from django.mail import EmailMultiAlternatives # or just EmailMessage if you don't need HTML

    subject = "Djrill Message"
    from_email = "Djrill Sender <djrill@example.com>" # this has to be in your Mandrill account's sending domains
    to = ["Djrill Receiver <djrill.receiver@example.com>", "djrill.two@example.com"]
    reply_email = "Customer Service <support@example.com>" # optional
    text_content = "This is the text version of your email"
    html_content = "<p>This is the HTML version of your email</p>" # optional, requires the ``attach_alternative`` line below

    msg = EmailMultiAlternatives(subject, text_content, from_email, to, headers={'Reply-To': reply_email})
    msg.tags = ["one tag", "two tag", "red tag", "blue tag"] # optional, Mandrill-specific message extension
    msg.metadata = {'user_id': "8675309"} # optional, Mandrill-specific message extension
    msg.attach_alternative(html_content, "text/html")
    msg.send()

If the Mandrill API returns an error response for any reason, the send call will raise a
``djrill.mail.backends.djrill.DjrillBackendHTTPError`` exception (unless called with fail_silently=True).

Djrill supports most of the functionality of Django's ``EmailMessage`` and ``EmailMultiAlternatives``.
Some limitations:

* Djrill accepts additional headers, but only ``Reply-To`` and ``X-*`` (since that is all that Mandrill accepts). Any
  other extra headers will raise a ``ValueError`` exception when you attempt to send the message.
* Djrill requires that if you ``attach_alternative`` to a message, there must be only one alternative type, and it
  must be text/html. Otherwise, a ``ValueError`` exception will be raised when you attempt to send the message.
  (Mandrill doesn't support sending multiple html alternative parts, or any non-html alternatives.)
* Djrill (currently) silently ignores all attachments on a message.
* Djrill treats all cc and bcc recipients as if they were additional "to" addresses. (Mandrill does not distinguish cc,
  and only allows a single bcc -- which Djrill doesn't use. *Caution:* depending on the ``preserve_recipients`` setting,
  this could result in exposing bcc addresses to all recipients. It's probably best to just avoid bcc.)

Many of the options from the Mandrill `messages/send.json API`_ ``message`` struct can be set
directly on an ``EmailMessage`` object:

* ``track_opens`` - Boolean
* ``track_clicks`` - Boolean (If you want track clicks in HTML only, not plaintext mail, you must *not* set this
  property, and instead just set the default in your Mandrill account sending options.)
* ``auto_text`` - Boolean
* ``url_strip_qs`` - Boolean
* ``preserve_recipients`` - Boolean -- see the caution about bcc addresses above
* ``global_merge_vars`` - a dict -- e.g., ``{ 'company': "ACME", 'offer': "10% off" }``
* ``recipient_merge_vars`` - a dict whose keys are the recipient email addresses and whose values are dicts of
  merge vars for each recipient -- e.g., ``{ 'wiley@example.com': { 'offer': "15% off anvils" } }``
* ``tags`` - a list of strings. Any tags over 50 characters in length or starting with an underscore will raise
  a ``ValueError`` exception when you attempt to send the message, since Mandrill does not support them.
* ``google_analytics_domains`` - a list of string domain names
* ``google_analytics_campaign`` - a string or list of strings
* ``metadata`` - a dict
* ``recipient_metadata`` - a dict whose keys are the recipient email addresses, and whose values are dicts of
  metadata for each recipient (similar to ``recipient_merge_vars``)

If you have any questions about the python syntax for any of these properties, see ``DjrillMandrillFeatureTests`` in
tests.py.


Testing
-------

Tests require mock_ (``pip install mock``). To run the tests, either::

    python setup.py test

or::

    python runtests.py


Thanks
------

Thanks to the MailChimp team for asking us to build this nifty little app. Also thanks to James Socol on Github for his 
django-adminplus_ library that got us off on the right foot for the custom admin views. Oh, and, of course, Kenneth Reitz for 
the awesome ``requests`` library.
